    <string name="how_to_report_mistake_message">No one is perfect, and Sefaria is no exception. If you spot a mistake, we want to know about it. However, we find that most textual errors that get reported to us are not in fact mistakes. This is in part due to textual variances between different editions of a text. To properly report a typo or textual error to Sefaria, make sure to include what you think the text should be and what you are using to make your determination. If you are looking at a printed book, please provide enough information to uniquely identify the book you\'re using. If the edition you\'re using is not the same as the edition we are using, we will be unlikely to change the text based simply on differing textual traditions. We will only change it if we believe that either the printer made a mistake, or we made a mistake when we digitized a text. Textual differences can be handled by adding the second textual tradition as another text version.</string>
